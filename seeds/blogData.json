    "content": "The brand’s upcoming Valentine’s Day drop was inspired by vintage greeting cards, and features saccharine images of puppies surrounded by roses, or comically fluffy kittens painted against pastel backdrops. Printed on sweaters and dresses adorned with bows, the collection was meant to be a nostalgic, cheeky nod to romance. It was also designed using the AI image generator Midjourney. ",

The device doesn’t have a monthly subscription fee at the moment. The device, designed by Teenage Engineering, has a 2.88-inch touchscreen, a push-to-talk button, a camera, a speaker, and two mics. The company has already sold 50,000 devices in pre-orders.",

Also known as bossware, it is pitched by its makers as a way to help boost productivity, but by those who endure it, it’s a surefire way to deplete morale. Having once been subjected to intrusive screenshots as a remote contractor, my view is clearly the latter, so I wish I could say employee surveillance tech was on its way out; on the contrary, it seems to be on the rise, helped in part by AI (not to mention a misguided distrust for remote work.)",
